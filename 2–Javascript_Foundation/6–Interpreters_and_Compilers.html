            <p>Welcome back</p>
            <p>Lets talk about Interpreters and compilers, which as we can see are important pieces in our javascript engine</p>
            <p>You see in programming there are generally two ways of translating to machine language, or something that our computers can understand</p>
            <p>And what we are gonna talk here are actually, applies to most programming languages, not just javascript. Python , Java, C++, any language you can think of is gonna use some of these concepts. So it is very important</p>
            <p>Lets start with the first one, the Interpreter, with an interpreter what we do is we translate and read the files line by line, on the fly. Lets have a look of how this works. </p>
