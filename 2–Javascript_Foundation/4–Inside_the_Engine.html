            <p>welcome back, so we know that this thing called the javascript engine, takes our written javascript code and does  some magic, to tell the computer to do what we want it to do. So What's happening inside this engine?</p>
            <p>And here is the tricky part. As we know this  engine can be built by anybody. Yes that means you can build your own javascript engine, but its a lot of work an at the end of the day. It is just a program.</p>
            <p>And the V8 engine, which is the more popular, the most common and someone say the fastest javascript engine, that  the chrome browser and node.js uses, which we will talk about later on, this engine is is written in C++, a low level programming engine, but lets see what its actually happening inside here</p>
            <p>Inside this engine, it looks like  something like this. We give it a javascript file, and first it does is called lexical analysis, which breaks the code into something called tokens, to identify their meaning, so we know what the code is trying to do, and these tokens are form in what we call an AST, that is an abstract Syntax Tree.</p>  
            <p>So we parse the code, we try to  figure out how the text is divided up, based on keywords from javascript, and it gets form into this tree like structure, called Abstract Syntax tree. ANd  there is a fun little tool  online that you can use, to demo this</p>
            <p>If we go to 'astexplorer.net'</p>
            <p>I will show how this Abstract Syntax Tree looks like, and we have a bit of code here</p>
