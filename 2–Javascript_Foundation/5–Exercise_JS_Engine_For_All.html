            <p>What problem do you see with everybody creating their own engines in javascript?</p>
            <p>What problem orr problems do you see with everybody creating their own engines in javascript? Like just we  did</p>
            <p>Can we just create our own engine and all of a sudden, Boom there it is we have ou own javascript engine? Well yes you can definitely can do that. but remember our list over here. How it was called ECMAScript Engines and not Javascript Engines. That is because if everybody can just create a javascript engine, it will ust be a total caos. Which is why ECMAScript was created. It tells people, hey, here the standard and how you should do things in javascript, and how it should work, and ECMAScript is the governing body of javascript that essentially decides how the  language should be standardized. So it tells engine creators this is how javascript should work. But internally, how you build the engine is up to you as long as it conforms to the standards</p>
            <p>And if we go back to the example over here, this engine,  inside of this box,  as long as it conforms to the ECMAScript standards, I can do whatever I want, as an engine creator, so companies and organizations, are battling to have the fastest engine, so people use their tool.</p>
            <p>for example google is really interested in having the fastest engine, soo  that more people use their chrome browsers, so that they use their search engine, so that they can sell more adds, and more revenue</p>
            <p>But keep this in mind, that this can be implemented in any way we want, and it constantly changes, to find the fastest way possible to have javascript work in our browsers orr outside of our browsers, and we are going to be talking about the V8 engine here, because it is the most popular. And you might see some different variations of this</p>
            <p>But what we are gonna talk over here,  applies to most javascript engines, and although things may change over time, as long as you understand the principles, and why it is built the way it is, we are gonna be  able to understand how to write optimized code</p>
            <p>Before we get into that, lets talk about this tings are, we have the interpreter, and the compiler</p>
            <p>I  see you in  the next video</p>
