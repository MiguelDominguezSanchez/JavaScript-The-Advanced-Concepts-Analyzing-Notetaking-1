            <p>Hello, we are starting an advanced coourse with 'How JavaScript Works'</p>
            <p>But I already know how JavaScript works, I write JavaScript every day, dont wasting my time Andrei</p>
            <p>I know you are gonna to give me a hard time, but, Let me ask you this. When  you write code on a file, do you know what happens, how does the browser read the file? How is JavaScript executed? How does Node.js Work? We write code code in a text editor, and somehow this code magically turns into ones and ceros too tell the  compuuter to do something</p>
            <p>In this section and to beggin thi s course, I want to build what I think is the most important foundation of laerning any language. If somebody ask you, hey can yoou explain how JavaScript Works, as if I was five?(grammatical error Andrei 'Five years old') You are gonna be  able to answer it by the  end of this section</p>
            <p>Knowing something deeply, is being able to understanding it so well, that you  can explain  to anybody, even to someone without technical knowledge. More importantly you will have an understanding of the language in a deeper level that most people in the industry, that  you can write better code. Lets have  a look that what we are gonna talk about</p>
            <p>In the first part we are gonna talk about: The JavaScript Engine, JavaScript Runtime, About Interpreters, Compilers, and JIT Compilers, we are gonna talk about Writing Optimized Code, we are gonna talk about Call Stacks, Memory Heaps, and some of the things that we have to be careful, when itt comes to stacks and heaps, and  that is Stack Overflow and Memory Leaks, we are gonna talk aboout Garbage Collection, about Node.js, and how it fits into this whole giant javaScript ecosystem and its Single Threaded Model. And using what we see in this section, we are gonna be able to use these fundamentals, as we learn higher level concepts, as we move through the course, so hang in there. Even  if you have a good understanding of how JavaScript works, you may learn a thing or two. We are also going to have  a little bit of coding, but most exercises in  this section, are going to be  though  experiments, and a lot more code is gonna come up in future sections, so hang in there, and I hope you are as excited as i am to start the course. Its going to be a lot of fun. Lets get started shall we. See you in  the next one</p>
