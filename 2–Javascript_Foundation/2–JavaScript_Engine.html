        <h1>2–JavaScript_Engine</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Almost everyone that has worrked witth JavaScript, has heard of the V8 Engine, the idea of the JavaScript Engine, and most people know that JavaScript is a single threaded language. It uses a callback queue. You may also have heard phrases like, 'JavaScript is an interpreter language'lets tackle of what that means over the next couple of videos. What is this engine that we speak of?'</p>
            <p>Well if I write some code, like lets say (#1 – js stylesheet)</p>
            <p>well we have just wrote some JavaScript,
                assigning the true boolean to the variable isHappy,
                know, how do we read this?
                or, How does the computer read this?
                Image if somebody comes up to you, 
                and gives you a computer, and they tell you,
                hey tell this computer to display a picture of horses on the screen,
                and you start looking at this computer and,
                you tell the computer to display an image of a horse,
                or horses in french, is the computer going to understand you, no, the computer will have no idea of what you have just said.
                In similar fashion,
                if I gave a computer with a CPU a file that is a JavaScript file, and I tell it,
                hey read this file and do something for me,
                well the  computer only understands ones and ceros,
                at the end of the day,
                and when we gave it a javascript file, well is like me talking  with a computer in french, is the computer being like, what, what are you talking about,
                plus talking to a computer in french, and people is going to look at you like if you are crazy, and so the computer doesn't really know about what javascript is,
                so how are we be able to communicate using a javascript file, so that the computer displays pictures of horses?
                And this is the first step in our learning, and that is the javaScript Engine.
                </p>
            <p>By having a JavaScript Engine, right over here,
                it allows you to get this machine, the javascript file, and this machine is going to understand the javascript file and tell the computer what to do. To display pictures of horses. In a sense you have just created a translator. so you can comunicate with somebody that doesn't know your language. And this special engine called special engine understands javascript. Our computer finally understands us because of this javascript engine, and it says I am on it boss, I start to display those hose pictures. There you go thats our first step, and over the next couple of videos we are gonna talk about exactly of what is happening inside. But do you think there is one javascript engine o many javascript engines?</p>
            <p>Well as you can see form this wikipedia list, there are a ton oof engines, and they are calle ECMAScript engines, and we are going into why that is later. Butt  these are all the javascript engines, tthen you may have heard of V8 or spidermonkey, or chakra, so any time we use an engine, we  are able to give  it a javascript file, this javascript file gets understood by the engine, and it allows this engine to comunicate and tell the machine the computer to do what we asked to do with javascript</p>
            <p>Now these engines are written by programmers. Fo example V8 engine is written in C++. But why do people write these engines? 2008 mark a really pivotal moment in history when it comes to javascript, because v8 was released by google. Before them most browsers use engines that were very basic. Which meant that javascript was a little bit slow.</p>
            <p>You see google had this problem, they have something called google maps. And google maps as you know, requires a lot of power. It does a lot of things, you can ask it for directions, zoom it and zoom out, maybe even use street view. And all the previous engines before it will make google maps very very slow on the browser. And google, because they are a search engine, they wanted everybody to use their search engine, and  they build a browser in order for them to control more of the market. So with google maps and their own chrome browser. They said, ummm, we are gonna write our own javascript engine, the V8 engine, so javascript runs way faster on the browser than its done previously</p>
            <p>And in 2008 they released v8, but the big take away for us here is that really really smart people work in these engines, so our javascript runs as fast as possible, on  the browser, on the server, on any type of computer. So every day javascript ruuns faster and faster, because the work that goes into these engines. Hey but what inside this engine. This magical magine  that understands javascript, it reads our code and  then it runs this code</p>
            <p>Lets get into that in the upcomming video, bye bye</p>
