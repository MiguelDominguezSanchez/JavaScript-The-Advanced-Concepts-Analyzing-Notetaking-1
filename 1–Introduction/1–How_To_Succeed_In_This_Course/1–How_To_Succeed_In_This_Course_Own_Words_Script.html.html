    <h1>1–How_To_flourish_In_This_Course</h1>

    <p>
        What does flourish mean?  

        Grow or develop in a healthy or vigorous way, especially as the result of a particularly congenial environment.

        (img – Who is this course for?). 

        The construction of the route facilitate that, different degree of JavasScript understanding from different pupils, will arrive at the exact spot ultimately. For the purpose of substantiate a enjoyable journey for all.
        
        Lets take a glance (img – Course Delineation) this is our track delineation(attached imgs Diagram).

    </p>
    <p>What does this course is all about?</p>
    <p>The course kicks off with the basis. 
        
        To ensure that we settle the foundations set down in order to channel the further learning.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        We are going to tackle these topics 

        (JavasCript Engine, JavaScript Runtime, Interpreter//Compiler/JIT Compiler, Writing Optimized Code, Call Stack + Memory Heap, Stack Overflow + Memory Leaks,  Garbage Collection, Node.js, Single Threaded Model), 
        
        some of them quite advanced</p>

    <p>
        Afterwards we address the language per se. 
        
        Facing the points.
        
        (Execution Context, Lexical Environment, Scope Chain, Hoisting, Function Invocation, Function Scope vs Block Scope, Dynamic vs Lexical Scope, this – call,apply,bind, IIFE)
    
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the base is set, 

        we are going to cover higher-level points. 

        We are going to buckle down to Javascript Types. 
        
        (Static vs Dynamic Typed, Primitives Types, Pass by Reference vs Pass by Value, Type coercion, Arrays, Functions, Objects)
    
    </p>
    
        Next we are gonna undertake a crucial thing.

        The two legs of Javascript, something mighty.

        Closures and Prototypal Inheritance.

        An in–depth analysis, in order to comprehend why these two legs invigorate our programming skills.

        Additionally, we are going to take in other points.

        Each of these points construct our knowledge to cope with programming paradigms.

        </p>

        <p>

            The whole knowledge nourished(nurtured) so far know, 

            allocates us to conduct ways to structure and organize our code.

            We are going to perform the two principal manners to structure our code.

            Object oriented programming and Functional Programming.

            We are gonna carry other points out. 
            
            (this keyword, new keyword, Prototype, ES6  Classes, Java, Inheritance, Object.create(), Private vs Public, 4 Principles of OOP).
        
        </p>
        </p>

        After complete those points,

        We have a bonus to enriches our knowledge intake.

        To go the extra mile.

        Asynchronous Javascript, Modules, Error Handling and Data Structure,

        </p>

        The pyramid is settled on the basal Knowledge,

        building it up one step upon another.

        Each block assembles on top of the other.

    </p>
    
    <p>
        To Flourish,

        you ought to go along with the sections in order,

        you are going to acquire awareness.

    </p>

        Hereby, you know the course delineation,

        So what does 'to flourish' signify?

    </p>

    <p>

        Communicate with your peers in the channel community,

        Thats why we are within a community,

        in our to ask and help each other.

    </p>

    <p>

        If you don't understand the point tackled,

        cut short, take it easy, and return to it later.

        This is a long term learning curve.

        So linger in the course till you domain everything

</p>

    <p>

        Finalize the course utterly,

        rather than fragmented.

        The lectures are related amongst them.

        They articulate the pyramid.

        From the very beginning to the complex points

    </p>

    <p>

        Lets go ahead,

        get ready for the next lecture.
