    <h1>1–How_To_Succeed_In_This_Course</h1>
    <p>What does advanced JavaScript mean? Everyone has a  different idea about what advanced means. (img – Who  is this course for?). In order to make sure that the course can be enjoyed by every body. I have structured the course in a unique way, so that, although everyone will start at different levels of knowledge, you will all end up att the same place in the end. Lets have a look (img – Course Outline) this is our course outline(attached imgs Diagram).</p>
    <p>The course stars off with the foundations. To make sure that we have those building blocks in place to learn best practices, advanced topics, and how to write clean code</p>
    <p>We start diving quite deep into things like the javascript engine, runtime. Talking about interpreters, compliers, JIT compilers, we are going to talk about all these topics (JavasCript Engine, JavaScript Runtime, Interpreter//Compiler/JIT Compiler, Writing Optimized Code, Call Stack + Memory Heap, Stack Overflow + Memory Leaks,  Garbage Collection, Node.js, Single Threaded Model), some of them quite advanced</p>
    <p>And then dive deep into the language itself. Talking about some of the key term that you might have heard, but not fully understood.(Execution Context, Lexical Environment, Scope Chain, Hoisting, Function Invocation, Function Scope vs Block Scope, Dynamic vs Lexical Scope, this – call,apply,bind, IIFE) Execution context, Lexical environment, Dynamic vs Lexical Scope</p>
    <p>And once we are done with the foundations, and we are for sure ready for more advanced topics (Static vs Dynamic Typed, Primitives Types, Pass by Reference vs Pass by Value, Type coercion, Arrays,  Functions, Objects). We start getting into types in JavaScript. Talking about Static vs Dynamically Typed Languages, about type coercion, pass by reference, pass by value</p>
    <p>Then we are gonna  talk about some something really important. The Two Pillars, Something tht really makes JavaScript powerful. So these two  pillars are going to be closures and Prototypal Inheritance. Now you may know these topics. Now you may know these topics, but we  are going to go dive deep, and understand why these two topics are really powerful and make us great programmers. Along the way we are going to talk about some other topics as well, but all of these is for us to be set up to talk about the programing paradigms, this is where it gets fun.</p><p>All the knowledge that we have built up untill know to talk about ways to structure our code, organize our code in beautiful programs. We are gonna talk about the two main ways to structure our code. One is object oriented programming, the other one  is functional programming. And we are gonna dive deep into each of these topics (this keyword, new keyword, Prototype, ES6  Classes, Java, Inheritance, Object.create(), Private vs Public, 4 Principles of OOP). And also talk about Composition vs Inheritance. By the end of it you are gonna to learn some paradigms that have taken years and years, decades for programmers to learn, what these good practices are</p>
    <p>And to end all off, I have some  extra sections to go beyond, and learn about important topics like Asynchronous JavaScript, Modules in JavaScript and go over the history of modules, and also a topic that often gets forgotten about Error Handling, and how to properly doing it. And there may it be a small data structure section as well</p>
    <P>In the end all of this is a path to become a top ten percent JavaScript Developer</P>
    <p>The idea is that we are starting off our pyramid with the fundamentals, and going up that pyramid each step of the way. If one the videos you find the topic too hard oor advanced. I have included an apendix section, which teaches you the basic javascript topics for a beginner. This way no matter what are your level, you have a way to leanr each of the video, and reference each of the video in the apendix if you need more explanation. for advanced programmers, some of the beginning section might be too easy for you, I recommend you hang in there,  each section builds on top of the other, and you will learn things along the way, honestly</p>
    <p>Now to get the most out of this course, you should follow the lessons in order, since you may gain an insight orr two, even if you though oh leave me alone Andrei, I already  know this stuff, ok.</p>
    <p>Now that you have an idea of the outline, lets talk about what it mean to succeed in this course.</p>
    <p>First, make sure that you  use your online discord community, to communicate with the fellow students. Its like a classroom, ask question, do coding challenges, talk about coding exercises. When it comes to programming, there is nothing better than asking questions, and helping others. This is the most active developer community on Udemy, with  over  thousand developers online at anyone time</p>
    <p>Ahy time that you are feeling that you are watching a video, and not understanding the topic,   stop what you are doing,  take a break and come back to the problem, you wont be able to finish this course in one week. If you  are doing properly, it will take you a month to finish everything, so take your time. It isnt a spring is a marathon.</p>
    <p>Finally, try to complete the full course, instead of just parts of it. Most lessons are tie into one another, so they flow, and we keep building this pyramid of knowledge. We start from the  very basics, into more and more advanced topics.</p>
    <p>ALright, enough talk, start the course and get ready to be considered a top ten percent javascript developer</p>
    <p>Lets get start and see you in the next lesson</p>
