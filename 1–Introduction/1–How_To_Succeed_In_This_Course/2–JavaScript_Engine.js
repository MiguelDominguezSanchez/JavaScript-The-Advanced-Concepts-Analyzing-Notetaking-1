//#1 // JavaScript Engine
const isHappy = true

/*
well we have just wrote some JavaScript,
assigning the true boolean to the variable isHappy,
know, how do we read this?
or, How does the computer read this?
Image if somebody comes up to you, 
and gives you a computer, and they tell you,
hey tell this computer to display a picture of horses on the screen,
and you start looking at this computer and,
you tell the computer to display an image of a horse,
or horses in french, is the computer going to understand you, no, the computer will have no idea of what you have just said.
In similar fashion,
if i gave a computer with a CPU a file that is aJAvaScript file, and I tell it,
hey read this file and do something for me,
well the  computer only understands ones and ceros,
at the end of the day,
and when we gave it a javascript file, well is like me talking  with a computer in french, is the computer being like, what, what are you talking about,
plus talking to a computer in french, and people is going to look at you like if you are crazy, and so the computer doesn't really know about what javascript is,
so how are we be able to communicate using a  javascript file, so that the computer displays pictures of horses.
And  this is the first step in our learning, and that is the javaScript Engine.
By having the JavaScript Engine, weright ovver here,
it allows you to get this machine
